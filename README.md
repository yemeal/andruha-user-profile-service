# Andruha User Profile Service

## Purpose and current status

This repository is the skeleton for the Andruha Messenger User Profile Service. It contains package boundaries and operational HTTP infrastructure only. No messenger business behavior is implemented.

## Responsibility and explicit non-responsibilities

Own editable public profile data in future iterations.

It does not own credentials, authentication sessions, messages, media object bytes, or realtime delivery.

## Hexagonal/DDD layer map

- `domain`: framework-free future business model.
- `application`: future use cases and owned ports; depends only on domain.
- `infrastructure`: future adapters implementing application ports.
- `entrypoints`: transport translation that will call application services.
- `core`: configuration and cross-cutting logging only.

The dependency direction is `entrypoints -> application -> domain` and `infrastructure -> application ports -> domain`.

## Entrypoints

- `app.entrypoints.http.main:create_app` - FastAPI factory
- `GET /health/live` - process liveness
- `GET /health/ready` - initialized application readiness

No business API or transport contract is available yet.

## Configuration variables

- `SERVICE_NAME`, `APP_VERSION`, `APP_ENVIRONMENT`
- `HOST`, `PORT`
- `DEV_LOGS`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `MUTE_LOGGERS`

## Liveness and readiness

`GET /health/live` reports that the process is running. `GET /health/ready` reports readiness after application lifespan initialization. It intentionally performs no fake dependency probes.

## Local build and run status

Runtime and test dependencies are declared and locked for Python 3.14. The
service can be verified from this repository with:

```powershell
poetry sync --with dev --no-root
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run ruff format --check .
poetry run pytest
docker build --target runtime --tag andruha/user-profile-service:local .
```

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint, strict Pyright, unit and integration
tests, branch coverage >= 80%, runtime dependency audit, secret scanning, and a
Docker smoke test. `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes a verified image
to GHCR only for a version tag. Business APIs and persistence remain deferred.
